SpliceSeq - Alternative Splicing Analysis of RNASeq data.
---------------------------------------------

SpliceSeq is an application that aligns RNASeq reads to models of all human genes.  The analysis produces splice graphs annotated with read totals and percent-spliced-in (PSI) values for all potential splice events.  SpliceSeq can perform comparative analysis between samples or groups of samples to find significant differences in splicing patterns.  The results are presented in a dynamic, graphical interface that allows sorting/filtering of splice events and exploration of splicing changes and the impact on protein product.
